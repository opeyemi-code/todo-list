# todo-list

Hi, thanks for taking the time to check out my todo-list repository. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps in documenting and tracking your daily task. It has some functionality such as adding a task, completing a task by clicking once on the marked button and undoing a task by double clicking on the task, you can as
 well delete the task.
